Those I asked eventually began to learn about it, were saved by it, were moved by it, and became inspired by it.\n\nThere are innumerable masterpieces in the Artisanship Commission, but never has there been a pièce de résistance that symbolizes the artistry and workmanship of craftsmen — until the Hexanexus disrupted the status quo. To us, the Hexanexus represents the heart and soul of craft masters, and the original intent of creation. Only with such a soul can one begin their first step on the path to mastery. We who still walk the path will inevitably experience joy and sorrow, but as long as the Hexanexus exists, we can look at the future with hope and smiles.\n\nOur society's goal is to spread unforeseen joy and passion to all the people in the world through the Hexanexus, to fill life with curiosity and euphoria.\n\nWith Utmost Respect,\nThe Hex Club",
