As these constraints multiply, humans grow further and further from the Titans they were once close to... eventually forgetting the past, unaware that both sides could be subject to a higher destiny. If we interpret it this way, then the roles of shepherd and sheep could apply to any of us â€” they could even be one and the same (just as hinted in the opening passage!)\"",
