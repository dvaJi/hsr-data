They had been shepherds for so long that they had forgotten they, too, could be hunted and slaughtered like sheep. At the end of the Era Chrysea, humanity faced an unprecedented, all-encompassing defeat. The old heroes had died, while new heroes had yet to be born. Everything was in disarray, and all hope seemed lost. The once-thriving civilization now cast a vast shadow, and those with ambition could only chew on an ashen, bitter fate with decaying, cavity-ridden teeth.\"",
