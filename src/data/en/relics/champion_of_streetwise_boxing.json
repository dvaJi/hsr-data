      "backstory": "Having grown up on the streets, Lindsay had never thought of boxing in official matches for she never believed she could be defeated by anyone, let alone someone who already has a foot in the grave.\n\nThe old lady calling herself a boxing coach provided Lindsay with a full set of protective gear and challenged the young girl to a bout, demanding Lindsay to train under her if the old lady managed a win.\n\nLindsay was too proud to use the complicated protective gears and tossed them all aside. She thought she could rely on her quick reactions for an easy win, but the old lady got near her in three strides and landed a blow straight to her face. When Lindsay regained consciousness, she picked up the boxing headgear she had tossed aside. Through the narrow opening of the headgear, she saw a brand-new world.\n\n\"So, these are the fists of a true boxer, huh? Interesting. If you want teach me, then train me to be the strongest boxer that ever lived.\"\n\nThough a bit begrudgingly, Lindsay accepted that she had lost the bet. Now, wearing protective equipment for the first time, she officially stepped into the world of boxing."

      "backstory": "When Lindsay first entered the boxing ring, her fighting style was utterly unbalanced, for she only knew how to attack but never how to defend. \n\nAll her years of street fighting were inadequate to prepare her for the fight in the ring. The match arranged by Icaterina put Lindsay into her place.\n\nA series of successive defeats in local fights shattered Lindsay's arrogance and deeply humbled her, forcing her to reflect on the balanced offensive and defensive rhythm that Icaterina was teaching her. As if kissed by the goddess of combat, this once-stubborn street fighter gradually came to understand the significance and joy of balancing offense with defense. The next thing she knew, her hand wraps were torn, and her gloves soaked with sweat and blood.\n\n\"Never let yourself fall into your opponent's traps. Remember your own rhythm.\"\n\nNow Lindsay finally came to appreciate Ica's words and her loving gaze. The usually stern Ica had long loved Lindsay like she would her own child."

The sounds of quick and heavy punches on the sandbag echoed throughout the gym.\n\nSweat soaked through her chest guard and the scorching steam detached Lindsay from reality, making her crave to escape it all.\n\nLindsay tried her best to control her emotions as her face glimmered with sweat and tears. Late into the night, she finally took off her chest guard and wrote the name \"Ica\" on the inside. She wants to swear she would achieve victory for this name. This was a key match in Lindsay's path to becoming the boxing champion, and her first fight without her coach by her side. Before Lindsay stepped into the ring, she held out her chest proudly to the camera.\n\n\"Lindsay.. I couldn't believe you share the same name with my daughter. I always thought I was done with the world for good when she passed, until I finally met you. Thank you, Lindsay.\"\n\n\"Protect me, Ica.\" The most important name was right by her heart."

Such was the power of what was known as Lindsay's Dance.\n\nTo train Lindsay's unique footwork, Icaterina took the street urchin to a high-society ball, where they danced hand in hand, spin after spin... Though clumsy at first, Lindsay eventually got the hang of the refined dance steps. She realized that there was more to this old boxing coach than met the eye. Among the flowing sea of dancers, a soft spot in Lindsay's heart was suddenly struck by a magical feeling.\n\n\"One more dance?\"\n\nLindsay's upbringing on the street did not at all prepare her for such experiences. Seeing the twinkle in Icaterina's eyes, how could Lindsay refuse?"
