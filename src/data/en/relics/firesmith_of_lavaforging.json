One day, at the foot of a volcano, Foy found a deposit of rare obsidian flame crystal. From this, he carefully polished a pair of protective goggles, which transformed the fierce sparks of fire into pale-white silhouettes. However, the greedy smith was unable to fully escape his cursed fate, losing everything to the bright light of his forge.\\n\\nFoy deemed the Antimatter Legion in the Warring Hearth as the raw materials for his creations, and himself as the rising flame.\\n\\n\"I wonder... is it possible to harness the power of a thermonuclear reaction in the furnace?\" Foy's pursuit of the ultimate fire came to an unfruitful end in an out-of-control thermonuclear fusion."

Indeed, all Firesmiths are remarkably talented at controlling flames, but only the best among them are bestowed with a ring of flame-mastery as a marker of their superb skill.\\n\\nThe Warforge had long ceased to differentiate between the Firesmith and the materials. All those Firesmith masters who had been smelting and smithing the Antimatter Creatures all this time had also become part of the Weapon of Destruction\\n\\n\"The quality of smelting depends on the fire, and the quality of the fire depends on the Firesmith.\" This is matter-of-fact knowledge to any Firesmith who is able to control high temperatures."

Neither the bubbling of toxic gases nor the gurgling of lava could interrupt his concentration. Though hot molten rock would splash on Surtur's fireproof apron of giant firelizard skin, the gear never lost its luster.\\n\\nA massive proportion of the Legion's fighting forces were repeatedly hammered and smelted until their flesh and weaponry were forged together by the Firesmiths, becoming weapons of Destruction.\\n\\n\"Yes, power of incomparable destruction...\" The Firesmiths have never hidden the terrible aspirations they place in their weapons as they control the flames."

The chief poured in all his resentment and humiliation into the forge and would never be tired, not even by days of non-stop hammering. Upon one hammering after another, the once stubborn and proud antimatter creatures had to eventually change their form and give in to the remolding by the Destroyer.\\n\\nDespite being free from any tangible cages, the Firesmiths' obsession with forging had become another form of prison for them, had it not?\\n\\n\"Flesh and blood are a burden. Forging is also destruction.\" The chief looked at the ever-growing number of deformed Firesmiths and lamented."
