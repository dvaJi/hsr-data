  "desc": "In that hidden experiment, various illusions constantly surged forward, pulling at his steps.\n\nThe seductive whispers beckoned him to give up on that treacherous topic, for what reason was there to gamble his life?\nThe cold, threatening voice declared that those who walk the edge of life and death will ultimately burn their lives away.\nThen there were the angry accusations, shouting to cast the blasphemer — the one who had desecrated the gods — into an execution grounds most cruel.\n\n\"The performance of life, too, must eventually reach the curtain call.\"\n\nHe closed his eyes, grasped the divine flame, and let the pain drown his fading soul.\nFirst, his resolute gaze. Then, his beating heart. The complete soul... He threw himself willingly into that most pure and intense flame to be used for the smelting—\n\nThe voices bubbled and then became silent.\nIn the darkness, the brilliant truth began to take shape in his hands.",
