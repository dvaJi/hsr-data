  "story": "Caravans in Amphoreus often sell these mysterious, loosely twine-wrapped bundles. They could be unwanted trash or gifts from the Titans to mortals, with unpredictable surprises upon opening. It's said that this is a tradition among Oronyx's followers, who view such enigmatic goods as a ritual of offering pros and cons to fate, leaving the power of determining value to the Evernight Veil's capriciousness.\n\n\"Heh heh heh, in truth, this idea was invented by old Zagreus, and the faithful who buy it aren't motivated by piety at all â€” they just love the thrill of the gamble!\"",
