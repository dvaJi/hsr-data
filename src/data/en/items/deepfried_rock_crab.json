  "story": "Fried Rock Crab with a crispy crust and tender inside. This kind of crab wreaked havoc in Belobog before the Eternal Freeze occurred, and then inexplicably almost became extinct.\nThe meat of it is soft, tender, and delicious. Could this be the reason for their extinction? You dare not think further.\n\n\"Even if Rock Crabs live in rocks, they are still seafood. Don't you see they have the word \"crab\" in their name?\"",
