  "story": "A luxurious delicacy beloved by both nobles and citizens alike. Its surface is caramelized into a crisp shell with sweet honey, while the inside remains a soft, semi-melted cheese. It's said to have been invented by an anonymous priest from the Dawncloud, who accidentally left the offering vessel too close to a burning hearth during a ritual. \n\n\"Recipes meticulously crafted by humans are often bested by the gods' serendipitous revelations.\"",
