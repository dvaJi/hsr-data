  "story": "A low-quality syrupy drink that is rumored to be the true and original recipe for SoulGlad.\nThe foul water, sickeningly sweet syrup, and mediocre taste meant this drink is banished to the depths of the Dreamscape's shelves. But in a time before the arrival of the sweet dreams, this was the spring water that cleansed both tears and blood, a fine wine made to soothe the bitterness of the years.\n\n\"They used flavoring to mask its strange taste, used coloring to hide the poor quality, and used carbonation to deprive it of flatness â€” But the truth hidden within the bottle will never disappear.\"",
