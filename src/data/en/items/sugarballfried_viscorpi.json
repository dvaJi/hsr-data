Viscorpi are a decaying alien civilization that thrives on parasitizing the orifices of primates, such as the ear canals and nasal cavities, to induce hallucinations.\n\n\"Legend has it that in ancient times, our ancestors fought a long and arduous battle against the viscorpi... Eventually, they went extinct. How did they go extinct? Well, it wasn't because we ate them all, that's for sure.\"",
