  "story": "The wars between Cloud Knights and Denizens of Abundance can last for a long time, even across several Amber Eras. The Cloud Knights tend to spend a long time in garrisons and invented many tasty foods for field consumption. The Field Nutrient Bar is easy to carry and particularly sought-after by the troops.\nThe nutrient bar tastes like smoked meat with notes of honey and candy.\n\n\"Mix peanuts with dried bean curds and wrap with ambergris. Has a nutty flavor to it.\"",
