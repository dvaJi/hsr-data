  "story": "Puffergoat milk, also known as Gentle Halcyon milk, is a specialty of the Xianzhou Alliance.\nThe milk is difficult to preserve and rarely seen outside Xianzhou.\nIt is sweet after warming without needing extra sugar, but it becomes bitter after cooling, so it must be drunk while hot.\n\n\"According to the Lifitide magazine, General Jing Yuan has to drink a large bowl of freshly squeezed Puffergoat milk every morning. The Seat of Divine Foresight has denied this report.\"",
