  "story": "High-purity redsoil is a rather unusual material: During the drying process, the crystallizing insoluble salts cause the entire block of redsoil to harden into a compact whole that is difficult to erode, even by wind and rain. Interestingly, for dromases, the most delicious redsoil lies right at the threshold between wet and dry.\n\n\"So if it keeps raining... would the dromases get eating disorders?\"\n\"In theory, it's possible, but Aquila would never let that happen, rest assured.\"",
