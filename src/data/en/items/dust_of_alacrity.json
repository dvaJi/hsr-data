It contains a secret recipe: take the seeds of life, Virtual Particles of energy, and Stone of The Hunt representing the Aeon's Path; grind them into powder and mix to a ratio of 2:5:1 â€” you'll get the magical dust. Applying the dust to your body makes you exceptionally agile and swift.\n\n\"Sparrowhawk, bathe in the dust of our ancestors and fly to the top of the mountain. Bring the sacred banner back to our tribe.\"",
