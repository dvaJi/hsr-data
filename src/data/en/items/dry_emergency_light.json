  "story": "An emergency light from the outworld civilization of Insumousu. This small portable lamp requires no source of energy. Simply soak it in brine with 5% salt concentration and it will shine for hours. It is actually the luminescent fishing rod antennae on the dorsal fin of a Thalassa lightfish. In ancient Insumousu, only the bravest fishers dared to hunt these dreadful creatures. Now, however, these fish are being cultivated on an industrial scale.\n\n\"Darling, I know you're trying to be romantic with this outworlder-style candle-lit dinner but... there's a shining fish head baring its teeth at me in the middle of the table. I don't think I can finish dinner...\"",
