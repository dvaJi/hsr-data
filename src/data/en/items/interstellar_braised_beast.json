  "story": "The fitness meal developed by Juhuan, the \"Brawn Author.\" It is made from intensely boiling meat from different interstellar beasts. It is extremely nutritious but extremely foul in taste â€” However, given how Juhuan craves to become a god, the pain he must endure while eating is a part of his trials too.\nBy the way, he's already writing the mantra that he will distribute to his disciples once he ascends to godhood. It's temporarily named The Compendium of Juhuan's Brawn Doctrines.\n\n\"I have witnessed the Grandmaster Juhuan in the gym speaking with 250 great brawny warriors: 'Barbell back squat! Lateral raises with dumbbells! Strong biceps can stop a crying child! Good lats can make you divine incarnate! Gimme ten sets! Gimme all you've got! You look the best when you're trying hard!'\"",
