  "story": "A beverage that {NICKNAME} sells on {TEXTJOIN#87}. In reality, it is an expensive drink of single malt juice, but you can imbibe it as much as you want in the Dreamscape.\nUnder Boothill's recommendation, a bullet will be left soaked in the drink when sold. He said this would add a special flavor, but maybe only his augmented tongue could taste it.\n\n\"Son of a nice lady, if you can't even taste the fragrant mellowness that brass and gunpowder add to this malt juice, then don't screwubbaboo the good hooch! Hand it over, I'll do the drinkin' for ya!\"",
