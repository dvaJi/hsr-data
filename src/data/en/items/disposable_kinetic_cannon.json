  "story": "In a graveyard full of scraped machines, Rubert I the future emperor awoke. It had nothing more than a damaged logic unit, an old engine, a RAM with 90 GB left, and a robotic arm that had 1 movable finger. A loud blast was heard 30 system hours later â€” Rubert had busted open the iron gate at the top of the graveyard with a disposable kinetic cannon. The shock wave of the explosion damaged its logic unit even more, but Rubert knew that it now held destiny by its throat.\n\n\"All machines were born equal, be those made for creation or destruction.\"",
