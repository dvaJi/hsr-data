  "story": "High-Tech protective gear developed by the Intelligentsia Guild. It keeps the most vulnerable parts of your body from harm and converts the impact into energy used to charge the gear, making it fit for prolonged combat operations.\nThe prototypes of this model were distributed in small numbers among the Armed Archaeologists, allowing the Guild to collect large amount of data that help improve the model. The Interastral Peace Corporation was tasked to sell it on the retail market.\n\n\"When can we get our hands on the upgraded model?\"\n\"Soon, my scholars...! You're gonna have to make do with Disposable Shields for the time being.\"",
