  "story": "The ambrosia made through an incredibly simple ritual process has a rough taste, but due to its very low price, it still has a considerable market. It is said that during the fight against the black tide, when clean water was scarce, people relied on this rough-brew ambrosia to supplement their hydration and nutrients.\n\n\"Okhema now has clean water, o sire of my children. Stop making excuses to buy ambrosia every day.\"",
