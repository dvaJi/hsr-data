  "story": "A classic Okheman delicacy â€” grilled dromas steak, best served on redsoil for the most authentic flavor. Much like cattle in many worlds, dromases used for meat are technically a different breed from those used for labor. This variety of dromas has tender and flavorful meat, but if not prepared properly, it's about as enjoyable as eating redsoil.\n\n\"I heard that the Mountain Dwellers who revere Georios never eat dromas meat. Is that true?\"\n\"Balderdash. Mountain Dweller, I am. When hungry, eat anything, especially if tastes good.\"",
