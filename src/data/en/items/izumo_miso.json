  "story": "A fermented food item created by an outworld civilization. A delicious pot of soup can be created by just placing a tiny chunk of this in boiling water. Additionally, it can also be used to stirfry, prepare a hotpot, or additional flavoring for meat. The poetic piece \"Litany of Miso Hotpot\" described it thusly:\n\n\"Green are the waters on which fragrant celeries glide, and yellow the daylilies that cast their deliciousness astride. As the boiling flow tumbles like fabrics bundled in a bind, the warmth of the taste does hollow stomachs a favor most kind.\"",
