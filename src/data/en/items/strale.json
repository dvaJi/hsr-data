  "story": "The Xianzhou strales have long been digitized before Xianzhou's interactions with the IPC ever happened. However, there are some collectors who still kept the Celest-Gold coins minted when the Alliance first came into existence. Shaped like the tip of an arrow or a narrow leaf, it seems to allude to the past and future of that civilization.",
