It is said to come from the divine corpus of the Chalice of Plenty spilled onto the earth, making it the perfect offering to the Titans. Just a few drops are enough to inebriate a mortal with its rich fragrance. Consuming it on its own leads to unconsciousness, as if one is drowning in a vast ocean.",
