  "story": "Salt crystals unearthed from the depths of the rift valley, revered by the farmers who toil on the land. Many keep one of these crystals in their homes, treasuring it as the \"bared spine marrow of Georios,\" a generous gift to the farmers. When reclaiming barren land, just a small sprinkling of this rock salt is enough to transform the barren soil into fertile ground, breathing life back into the earth. \n\n\"Non-organic, non-organic, non-organic, non-organic, non-organic fertilizer is the best!\"",
