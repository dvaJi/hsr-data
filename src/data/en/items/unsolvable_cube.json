  "story": "In the Mystic Cube Dueling Tournament famous throughout the Cosmos, the Cubemaster fills the peoples' magic cubes with a seventh color, sending thousands of foes hurtling off the stage. This unsolvable and devious scheme was finally shattered in the Tenth Amber Era by Dr. Cube. He defeated the Cubemaster on the physical level and then painted the six sides with the same color.\n\n\"Isn't physical dueling the focus of the Mystic Cube Dueling Tournament?\"",
