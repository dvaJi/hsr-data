  "story": "This beverage is rich and refreshing, with a uniquely wild and almost crude taste that impresses even connoisseurs outside of the Xianzhou. However, there is much debate among consumers about the exact combination of the \"five grains.\"\n\nIn our Thalassa Crystal Palace distillery, the so-called \"five grains\" are Diatomaceous Earth, Saltwort, Verdant Velvet, Lithosalt Blossom, and Shipwreck Grass.",
