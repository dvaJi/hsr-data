  "story": "An arrow narrower than a finger's width. It can be loaded into an electromagnetic crossbow or a thermal seeking bow as ammunition. Its power is enough to penetrate the tough shells of abominations with just one strike.\n\n\"The celestial banished arrives from afar, great distances journeyed 'twixt oceans of stars. Like rain falls a cloudburst of arrows below, in a helmet reflected the bright lunar glow.\"",
