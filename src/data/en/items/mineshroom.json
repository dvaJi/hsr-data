This is a type of fungi that exists only at the bottom of Khalnoss' oceans, and harvesting it can be quite dangerous as mishandling may lead to explosions. It tastes good and is extremely nutritious, while its blast radius can reach two meters, making it a high quality food item and an extremely potent weapon.\n\n\"I heard the military rations aboard the Yaoqing include dried mineshrooms. Not sure if that's true or not.\"\n\"Well, what can I say... using such a dangerous thing as food very much fits their stereotype...\"",
