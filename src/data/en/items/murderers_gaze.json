  "story": "You vividly recall that fateful night: Cowering in the cupboard, too terrified to make a sound. As the man who brutally murdered your parents turned his gaze toward you, the look in his eyes was etched into your memory.\nNow, as you stand over his lifeless body, the jubilation of vengeance courses through your veins. Yet, as you wash up, a sense of terror engulfs you as you catch a glimpse of your own eyes in the mirror.\n\n\"A seasoned detective can discern a murderer merely by looking into their eyes, for the eyes of murderers bear a chilling resemblance.\"",
