  "story": "Golden Honeycakes, one of the oldest delicacies in Amphoreus history, was once a favorite high-end dessert among the nobility. Now, it's becoming a trendy, fashionable food on Okhema's teleslate...\n\n\"This thing blew up way too fast... I'm a native Okheman, but I never had sweet pancakes at home growing up!\"\n\"Apparently, a dessert shop got Mr. Mydei to advertise it on the teleslate, and after it went viral, other businesses got envious...\"\n\"...But honestly, you have to admit, the new flavors they've developed are actually pretty good.\"",
