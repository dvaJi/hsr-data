  "story": "A simple remedy made by grinding blue maple deer antler, sprout combination remedy, and droppings from blue-winged squirrels into powder, then kneading them with honey to form pills. It has some healing effects, but not significant.\n\n\"Your medicine's effectiveness... is it any different from a bowl of brown sugar water?\"\n\"Of course it is. Brown sugar water is sweet, while my medicine is as spicy as drinking boiling water.\"",
