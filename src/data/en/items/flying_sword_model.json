  "story": "This travel souvenir sold aboard the Skysplitter, based on Yanqing's flying sword, is quite popular among tourists. Despite being a toy sword, its quality is immaculate, even serving as a suitable training prop for beginners. Yanqing once intentionally used it to beat several challengers who lacked martial virtue to the point of crying for their parents.\n\n\"Although your defeat this time is regretful, there's no need to be discouraged. If you're willing to challenge again, I'll be ready to accept anytime.\"\n\"Anytime? Then make sure you sleep with an eye open.\"",
