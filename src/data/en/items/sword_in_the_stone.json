  "description": "When used, increases ATK of all allies by 190 for the next battle.",
  "story": "There's a legend in Little Gui's homeworld: Whoever pulls out the sword in the stone would be the great hero foretold in prophecies.\nHowever, no one ever managed to pull it out, and few even tried â€” because that was a historical relic. You'd get jailed for damaging it.\n\n\"I regret it so much right now... I was just feeling impulsive at that moment and wanted to show off to my friends. That's why I went to pull out the sword. I hope everyone can learn from my mistake...\"",
