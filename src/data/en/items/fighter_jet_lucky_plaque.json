They create talismans using materials from such ships, seeking good fortune. These wooden plaques often have the inscription \"Safe\" on the front and \"Departure\" on the back.\n\n\"Lately, there have been more and more counterfeit goods. Some of these lucky plaques are completely shoddy! Look at this fake one, it has 'Reverent Departure' carved on the front and 'Respectful Entry' on the other side.\"",
