  "story": "Classic fast food from Penacony. Its origins can be traced back to when The Family first arrived in Penacony. In order to show respect to the distant Halovian visitors, the locals created this delicacy resembling their appearance. The Halovian Winged Burger symbolizes gratitude towards The Family. However, for the inhabitants of the Primordial Dreamscape, it seems to carry a different connotation...\n\n\"Thanks to The Family, praise to the Great One, may this burger fill our bellies!\"\n\"The Deplorable Family, hypocritical Halovians, I'll eat you up right now!\"",
