  "introduction": "◆ Introduction ◆\nBy a twist of fate, you've somehow become the parent of a baby dromas...?\nWell then, let's witness its extraordinary journey together!\n\n◆ Event Rules ◆\n● During the \"Nice Weather for Dromases\" event, plan weekly schedules to develop your baby dromas's three key stats and discover various traits. Different schedules create unique growth experiences for your baby dromas.\n● Every 3 weeks, your baby dromas will face an Evaluation Day. If their stats are sufficient, they can complete it alone. Otherwise, they'll need help from the Trailblazer. After passing the evaluation, they'll advance to the next growth stage.\n● Complete evaluations for all three stages (Fledgling, Adolescent, and Youth), and you'll record your journey together, document your growth story, and receive special decorations as rewards.\n\n◆ Regular Rewards ◆\n● Complete a certain number of Evaluation Days to claim the rewards.\n\n◆ Limited-time Rewards ◆\n● During the limited-time event, completing specified missions will earn you corresponding rewards.\n\n◆ Event Reminders ◆\n● After the \"Nice Weather for Dromases\" limited-time event ends, trailblazers will no longer be able to obtain the limited-time rewards, but they can still visit the \"Eternal Holy City\" Okhema map to speak with Anaxa, experience the event, and obtain permanent rewards.",
