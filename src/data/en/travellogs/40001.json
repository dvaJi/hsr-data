  "introduction": "◆ Introduction ◆\nA researcher from the space station found a combat simulation program of unknown origins called Stellar Flare. Running it can take the user into a simulated battleground, where you can practice warfare against different opponents.\nThere are special combat rules within the simulation. Familiarize yourself with them and build strategies for a smooth victory.\n\n◆ Event Rules ◆\nAfter the event starts, a new challenge stage will be unlocked each day, for a total of 8 stages.\nEach stage has 3 difficulties: Dwarf Star, Giant Star, and Supergiant Star, with ascending enemy strength and different gameplay. The Trailblazer can challenge the Giant Star difficulty straight away, and the Supergiant Star difficulty will be unlocked after completing the Giant Star difficulty.\nThe levels of enemies and any trial characters will be determined by the Trailblazer's current Equilibrium Level upon initiating the event for the first time. These levels will not be changed if your Equilibrium Level increases during the event.\n\n◆ Event Rewards ◆\nComplete a stage to claim its prize from the event screen. Completing higher difficulties will automatically grant rewards for the lower difficulties.\nThe Trailblazer can obtain Challenge Rewards after eliminating enemies in the third wave and sixth wave respectively in the Supergiant Star difficulty.",
