  "introduction": "◆ Introduction ◆\nWen Shiling, a Department of Implement Arts Researcher from the Herta Space Station, is currently compiling the research reports needed for this quarter. However, the Antimatter Legion's invasion created lots of extra work for her, and she was unable to collect the material required for her research in a timely manner. Therefore, she would like to hire a research assistant.\n\n◆ Event Rules ◆\nWen Shiling will announce one new \"research topic\" and its required \"experimental components\" every day during the event, for a total of seven topics.\nBy collecting and submitting today's required experimental components, the Trailblazer can obtain the day's research findings and rewards.\n\n◆ Event Rewards ◆\nThe Trailblazer will also receive All Good Potions when they submit experimental components. As research progresses, Wen Shiling will gradually develop a better understanding of the principles behind producing the All Good Potion. She will give the All Good Potion recipe as a reward at the end of the final experiment.",
