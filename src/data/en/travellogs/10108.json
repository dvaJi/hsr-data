The limits and attempts used so far can be viewed on the Garden of Plenty event page.\nThe double reward count will not reset during the event. Be sure to schedule your time for this challenge accordingly, Trailblazers.\nIf the double reward from both the Starlit Homecoming and Garden of Plenty events are active simultaneously, the Garden of Plenty event count will be prioritized for consumption when claiming rewards that fit the conditions for both events.\n\n◆ Event Rewards ◆\nBy completing Calyx (Golden) and Calyx (Crimson) and obtaining EXP Materials, credits, and Trace Materials, players will automatically consume an attempt to receive double rewards.",
