The limits and attempts used so far can be viewed on the Garden of Plenty event page.\nDouble reward count resets daily at <unbreak>04</unbreak>:<unbreak>00</unbreak> (server time). Please be sure to challenge them in a timely manner. \nIf the double reward from both the Starlit Homecoming and Garden of Plenty events are active simultaneously, the Garden of Plenty event count will be prioritized for consumption when claiming rewards that fit the conditions for both events.\n\n◆ Event Rewards ◆\nBy completing Calyx (Golden) and Calyx (Crimson) and obtaining EXP Materials, credits, and Trace Materials, players will automatically consume an attempt to receive double rewards.",
