  "introduction": "◆ Summary ◆\nThe Department of Ecology is spinning far too many plates: On the eve of the geniuses arriving, they started dedicated testing for the \"Unknown Lifeform Smell-Induced Perceptions and Hallucinations\" project, during which special scent plug-ins can be activated to trigger a change in perception, causing illusions to be seen. You have been commissioned to assist in this test. Please assist the Department of Ecology in gathering critical data by boldly facing down and defeating these illusions.\n\n◆ Event Note ◆\n● Once the event begins, Virtual Scentventure (Normal Mode) is unlocked first. Clear all stages in Normal Mode and talk to Cloudbot to unlock Despair Mode stages.\n● Trailblazers cannot claim limited-time awards after limited-time events are finished. \n\n◆ Virtual Scentventure ◆\n● Illusions simulated from scent stimulation are different from normal boss enemies. Please familiar yourself with their special traits prior to entering combat. \n● Unlock the next challenge by reaching a certain score.\n● Normal Mode enemies scale with difficulty based on your Equilibrium Level. Despair Mode enemy levels are fixed.\n● Use different scent plug-ins during the event to gain different ability bonuses in combat.",
